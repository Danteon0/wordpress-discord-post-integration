# ü§ñ WordPress Discord Post Integration

This project is an example of an integration used to automatically share new blog posts published on your WordPress site in a Discord channel. This way, every new post is automatically sent to the Discord channel you specify, allowing your followers to access the latest content instantly.

## üìú Prerequisites

To use this integration, you need the following requirements:

- **WordPress**: This project is designed to work on a WordPress site. You should have an up-to-date version of WordPress.
- **Discord Account**: You need a Discord account to implement the integration. You also need a Discord server where you want the messages to appear.
- **Web Server**: Your WordPress site needs to be hosted on a web server.

## üìÅ Creating a Discord Webhook

In Discord, you need to create a webhook to automatically share your WordPress posts. The webhook provides a URL to send messages to your Discord server. Here are the steps to create a webhook:

1. **Log in to Discord Server**: Open your Discord application and select the relevant server.
2. **Create Webhook**: Go to the server settings, click on the "Integrations" tab, and select "Create Webhook".
3. **Copy the Webhook URL**: Copy the URL provided for the created webhook. This URL will be used in the WordPress integration code.

## üìï WordPress Integration

After creating your Discord webhook, you can use it to share posts on your WordPress site. Follow these steps to implement the integration:

1. **Update the functions.php File**: Add the following code to the `functions.php` file in your WordPress theme files.

## üìó Code for functions.php

Below is an example PHP code that will automatically send new posts to your Discord channel in WordPress. This code integrates WordPress post submissions to Discord.

```php
<?php

function send_to_discord($title, $author, $date, $content, $link, $image_url, $webhook_url, $author_avatar) {
    $embed = array(
        "title" => $title,
        "url" => $link,
        "description" => $content,
        "color" => hexdec("7289da"), //Color code you want in the embed
        "footer" => array(
            "text" => "example.com is subject to copyright",
        ),
        "image" => array(
            "url" => $image_url,
        ),
        "author" => array(
            "name" => $author,
            "icon_url" => $author_avatar,
        ),
        "timestamp" => $date,
    );

    $data = array(
        "content" => "New Blog Post Published! @everyone",
        "embeds" => array($embed),
    );

    $options = array(
        'http' => array(
            'header'  => "Content-type: application/json\r\n",
            'method'  => 'POST',
            'content' => json_encode($data),
        ),
    );

    $context  = stream_context_create($options);
    $result = file_get_contents($webhook_url, false, $context);

    if ($result === FALSE) {
        error_log('An error occurred while sending the Discord webhook.');
    }
}

function discord_webhook_new_post($post_ID, $post) {
    // Return if already notified
    if (get_post_meta($post_ID, '_discord_notified', true)) {
        return;
    }

    // Run only for published posts
    if ($post->post_status !== 'publish' || $post->post_type !== 'post') {
        return;
    }

    $webhook_url = 'WEBHOOK_URL';
    $title = get_the_title($post_ID);
    $author = get_the_author_meta('display_name', $post->post_author);
    $author_avatar = get_avatar_url($post->post_author);
    $date = get_the_date('c', $post_ID);
    $content = wp_trim_words(get_the_content(null, false, $post_ID), 40, '...');
    $link = get_permalink($post_ID);
    $image_url = '';

    if (has_post_thumbnail($post_ID)) {
        $image_url = get_the_post_thumbnail_url($post_ID);
    }

    send_to_discord($title, $author, $date, $content, $link, $image_url, $webhook_url, $author_avatar);
    update_post_meta($post_ID, '_discord_notified', true);
}

function on_save_post($post_ID, $post, $update) {
    // Run only for published posts
    if ($post->post_status === 'publish' && $post->post_type === 'post') {
        // Add a short delay to ensure the image is fully loaded
        wp_schedule_single_event(time() + 5, 'send_to_discord_event', array($post_ID, $post));
    }
}

add_action('send_to_discord_event', 'discord_webhook_new_post', 10, 2);
add_action('save_post', 'on_save_post', 10, 3);
```

 2. **Update the Webhook URL:**
 - Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` with the webhook URL you created.

## üìï Sending a Message
You are now ready to send messages! You can use the `send_to_discord` function to send instant messages to your Discord channel from anywhere.
```php
send_to_discord($title, $author, $date, $content, $link, $image_url, $webhook_url, $author_avatar);
```

## üìï Considerations
**Security**: Do not share your webhook URL with anyone.
**Debugging**: If the message does not send, check your curl settings and webhook URL. For more support, you can join our Discord server.
